# Mobile Browser Game
  
A **mobile browser** is a web browser designed for use on a mobile device such as a mobile phone, PDA, smartphone, or tablet. Mobile browsers are optimized to display web content most effectively on small screens on portable devices. Some mobile browsers, especially older versions, are designed to be small and efficient to accommodate the low memory capacity and low bandwidth of certain wireless handheld devices. Traditional smaller feature phones use stripped-down mobile web browsers; however, most current smartphones have full-fledged browsers that can handle the latest web technologies, such as CSS 3, JavaScript, and Ajax.

Websites designed to be usable in mobile browsers may be collectively referred to as the mobile web. Today, over 75% of websites are "mobile friendly"[*citation needed*], by detecting when a request comes from a mobile device and automatically creating a "mobile" version of the page, designed to fit the device's screen and be usable with a touch interface.
 
The mobile browser usually connects via the cellular network, or increasingly via Wireless LAN, using standard HTTP over TCP/IP and displays web pages written in HTML. Historically, early feature phones were restricted to only displaying pages specifically designed for mobile use, written in XHTML Mobile Profile (WAP 2.0), or WML (which evolved from HDML). WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for transmission across limited bandwidth, and wireless data connection called WAP. In Japan, DoCoMo defined the i-mode service based on i-mode HTML, which is an extension of Compact HTML (C-HTML), a simple subset of HTML.
 
Smartphone mobile browsers are full-featured Web browsers capable of HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, as well as mobile technologies such as WML, i-mode HTML, or cHTML.To accommodate small screens, they use Post-WIMP interfaces.

The first deployment of a mobile browser on a mobile phone was probably in 1997 when Unwired Planet (later to become Openwave) put their "UP.Browser" on AT&T handsets to give users access to HDML content.[4][5]
 
A British company, STNC Ltd., developed a mobile browser (HitchHiker) in 1997 that was intended to present the entire device UI. The demonstration platform for this mobile browser (Webwalker) had 1 MIPS total processing power. This was a single core platform, running the GSM stack on the same processor as the application stack. In 1999 STNC was acquired by Microsoft[6] and HitchHiker became Microsoft Mobile Explorer 2.0,[7] not related to the primitive Microsoft Mobile Explorer 1.0. HitchHiker is believed to be the first mobile browser with a unified rendering model, handling HTML and WAP along with ECMAScript, WMLScript, POP3 and IMAP mail in a single client. Although it was not used, it was possible to combine HTML and WAP in the same pages although this would render the pages invalid for any other device. Mobile Explorer 2.0 was available on the Benefon Q, Sony CMD-Z5, CMD-J5, CMD-MZ5, CMD-J6, CMD-Z7, CMD-J7 and CMD-J70. With the addition of a messaging kernel and a driver model, this was powerful enough to be the operating system for certain embedded devices. One such device was the Amstrad e-m@iler[8] and e-m@iler 2. This code formed the basis for MME3.
 
Multiple companies offered browsers for the Palm OS platform. The first HTML browser for Palm OS 1.0 was HandWeb by Smartcode software, released in 1997. HandWeb included its own TCP/IP stack, and Smartcode was acquired by Palm in 1999. Mobile browsers for the Palm OS platform multiplied after the release of Palm OS 2.0, which included a TCP/IP stack. A freeware (although later shareware) browser for the Palm OS was Palmscape, written in 1998 by Kazuho Oku in Japan, who went on to found Ilinx. It was still in limited use as late as 2003. Qualcomm also developed the Eudora Web browser, and launched it with the Palm OS based QCP smartphone. ProxiWeb[9] was a proxy-based Web browsing solution, developed by Ian Goldberg and others[10] at the University of California, Berkeley and later acquired by PumaTech.
 
Released in 2001, Mobile Explorer 3.0 added iMode compatibility (cHTML) plus numerous proprietary schemes.[11] By imaginatively combining these proprietary schemes with WAP protocols, MME3.0 implemented OTA database synchronisation, push email, push information clients (not unlike a 'Today Screen') and PIM functionality. The cancelled Sony Ericsson CMD-Z700 was to feature heavy integration with MME3.0. Although Mobile Explorer was ahead of its time in the mobile phone space, development was stopped in 2002.
 
Opera software pioneered with its Small Screen Rendering and Medium Screen Rendering technology. The Opera web browser is able to reformat regular web pages for optimal fit on small screens and medium-sized (PDA) screens. It was also the first widely available mobile browser to support Ajax and the first mobile browser to pass the Acid2 test.
 
The following are some of the more popular mobile browsers. Some mobile browsers are really miniaturized web browsers, so some mobile device providers also provide browsers for desktop and laptop computers.
 
Mobile transcoders reformat and compress web content for mobile devices and must be used in conjunction with built-in or user-installed mobile browsers. The following are several leading mobile transcoding services.

It would be great if Evernote web supported mobile browsers. I realize that the fact that it doesn't currently is intentional as per the Devices FAQ but for people that need to log into Evernote on a mobile device occasionally but don't want to install the app or can't because of the device limit, this would be a nice feature.
 
Hi. Mobile access depends on the code behind the web page - can it recognise that a small screen device is connected and serve up pages that will fit the display? - and Evernote's original web page was some legacy code that didn't have that feature. The 'new' web page is/ was based on the old code, but we hear that a complete rewrite is in progress and 'should' be available within a month or three. That 'should' bring the options completely up to date, including things like mobile access. Evernote have only (unusually) confirmed that they're working on the page however, so don't assumed anything is a done deal. We'll have to wait and see.
 
Edit: Doh! and... I see that you were sent over here by Evernote to gauge the interest in this feature, so anyone who thinks this is a good idea, please click the counter at top left like I just did...!!
 
2) You are one of the oldtimers, so I know that you were using evernote (and the mobile web client) more the two years back when they blocked all access to the mobile WEB interfaces (one simple html, the other javascript) , right? Did you ever use the web on mobile back then, gazumped?
 
Mobile access I use all the time - via the Android App, which does pretty much everything (for me) that browser access would do, plus a bit more since the web app doesn't (AFAIK) duplicate notes or run a slideshow of pictures. I use the mobile to take pictures, scan barcodes, record audio (Cogi) and look up note content - photos, tickets, receipts etc.
 
Two use cases for me: (1) I have Evernote installed on my computer and my phone - this reaches the two device limit of the free account. I very occasionally (once every couple of months) need to use Evernote on my iPad. Being able to sign into Evernote Web for that would be useful. (2) Being able to access Evernote from someone else's tablet (iPad, Android, etc) to quickly check something, record a note, etc without needing to install Evernote.
 
I had important notes I needed to access. The iOS client went into one of its sulks - in this particular case it was apparently working but **returning the wrong content for a given note**so i was completely stuck.
 
Been using Evernote for a while now but never really went all in. Decided to go full digital and was looking for a way to take notes and grabbed the iPad. This is an older one that works great to watch movies, search the web, check e-mail and just about ever thing else I had been doing.
 
Unfortunately the iOS is old, and can't be upgraded, so I don't have access to the app. The Todoist site opens fine but Evernote is the hold up because it won't open in Safari. My plan was to use it for hand written notes, like I take with my phone, only on a size that is usable in a meeting. If everything works well then I would invest the money to get a newer device but I don't want to spend the money just to try it out.
